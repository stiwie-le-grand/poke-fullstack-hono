# Monorepo Starter with Hono & React

## Overview

This repository is a starter template for building full-stack applications using **pnpm workspaces** with a monorepo structure. It includes:

- **Hono** for the backend - a lightweight, ultrafast web framework.
- **React** for the frontend - a modern, component-based library.
- **pnpm workspaces** for efficient package management and dependency sharing.

## Features

- **Monorepo architecture** using `pnpm workspaces`
- **Backend** powered by Hono, optimized for speed and minimal footprint
- **TypeScript support** for type safety across the stack - Fully typed routes
- **Zero-config setup | Batteries included** to get started immediately
- **OAS, SWAGGER, SCALAR** available aout of the box
- **Runs on multiple runtimes** depending on the usecase hono is able to run on Deno, Bun, Node, hence AWS (Λλ or EC2)
- **E2E type safety with @hey-api/openapi** the frontend syncs with the API OAS schema

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/stiwie-le-grand/poke-fullstack-hono
cd poke-fullstack-hono
pnpm install
```

**If you do not have pnpm installed** you can find instructions here to install it: [install-pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

### Running the Project

#### Start API

```sh
pnpm run dev:server
```

#### Start Frontend

```sh
pnpm run dev:client
```

#### Start Frontend + API in the same process

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

#### Generate types

```sh
cd apps/client
pnpm generate-types
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173` by default, and the backend at `http://localhost:3000` respectively.

## Tech Stack

### Backend - Hono 🔥

Hono (meaning "flame" in Japanese) is an ultrafast, lightweight web framework built on Web Standards. It runs seamlessly across multiple runtimes, including **Cloudflare Workers, Fastly Compute, Deno, Bun, Vercel, Netlify, and AWS Lambda**.

#### Quick Example:

```ts
import { Hono } from "hono";

const app = new Hono();
app.get("/", (c) => c.text("Hello from Hono!"));
export default app;
```

### Frontend - React ⚛️

React is a powerful JavaScript library for building fast, dynamic user interfaces. It follows a component-based architecture and is optimized for performance and scalability.

#### Quick Example:

```tsx
import React from "react";

const App = () => {
  return <h1>Hello from React!</h1>;
};

export default App;
```

## Why Use This Starter and Hono?
